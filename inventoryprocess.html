        <h1>Stock Dispatch Guidelines</h1>

        <h2>1. Acknowledging Stock Dispatch</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It is mandatory that the respective salon manager accepts the delivery and closes the STN in the system within 24 hours of receipt.</li>
            <li>During delivery, if any discrepancies or damaged stock are noticed, the details must be noted on the document hard copy and acknowledged by the delivery person.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Reporting Discrepancies or Damages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All discrepancies or damaged stock identified at the time of delivery must be reported to the inventory team via email on the delivery date itself. Inventory team will rectify the query within 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Any issues not escalated within 24 hours of receipt will not be considered valid and will not be approved for resolution.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Inter-Salon Stock Transfers</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Open documents for inter-salon stock transfers must be acknowledged immediately upon delivery.</li>
            <li>If any products are not received or delivered, the documents must be deleted the same day to avoid discrepancies.</li>
            <li>Discrepancy due to such incomplete transaction will be debit to responsible salon.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Any document found open after the delivery and deadline time, stock dispatch will be held for those salons and wait till the documents are closed by the salon.</p>

        <p>Please ensure strict adherence to these guidelines to maintain accurate inventory records and streamline our stock management process.</p>

        <p>Kindly acknowledge receipt of this email and confirm your understanding and compliance with the new process.</p>
